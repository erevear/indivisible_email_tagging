Your DGB for today is to contact the Superintendent’s office of Bossier Parish Schools in Louisiana.

After the recent surge in public protests from professional athletes, Superintendent Scott Smith decided to threaten student athletes with disciplinary action for exercising their First Amendment rights, bringing to mind the forced Nazi flag salutes of 1930’s Germany. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/us/high-school-anthem-protest.html?mcubz=1

Today, you’ll call his office with the contact information provided below and give him hell using your own creativity or this DGB suggested script:

 

“The US Supreme Court ruled in 1943 that no student has to stand, salute, or even recite the Pledge of Allegiance. You’ve stepped way beyond the jurisdiction of your office and should walk back your threats immediately.”

 

http://www.bossierschools.org/supt_office

If you or someone you know in Louisiana has received a letter from your public school or district about a national anthem policy, let the ACLU know here:

"Your DGB for today is to sign this petition to change the name of Robert E. Lee Park in Dallas, TX to Erykah Badu Park.

A statue of Robert E. Lee was recently removed from a park in Dallas, TX, but the park is still named after Confederate General Lee. DGB wants to replace ALL confederate monuments, statues, and parks. So today we are just asking you to sign the petition to honor Dallas native Badu. If you happen to live in Texas, particularly Dallas, give your city council members a call. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-e-lee-park-erykah-badu_us_59cbae98e4b053a9c2f57003?section=us_black-voices

We think ya better call Dallas (call him)

And tell him come on, help you get your confederate shit."

"Your DGB for today is to remind Trump that he has never cared about the best interests of Puerto Rico.

Back in 2008, Trump companies made some big promises to slap their name on a failing golf resort and turn the operation into some sort of bigly success. Like most of their other money-making schemes, they stood to profit whether the resort itself did or not. By 2012, Trump & Sons had driven it even farther into the ground. They took their $600,000 and bounced, leaving the small island territory with a bankrupt property in the critical tourism industry. Puerto Rico managed to recover, as we know they will after the devastation from Hurricane Maria. Just like back then, it’ll be no thanks to Trump.

.@realDonaldTrump U bum, use your $600K profit from your failed Puerto Rico golf course to help their humanitarian crisis NOW."
"Your DGB for today is to plan to participate in the Twitter protest of the treatment of Black americans by taking a knee at 1:00 pm EST tomorrow, the 29th.

After Trump’s comments calling for NFL owners to fire anyone that takes a knee for the National Anthem, more than 100 NFL players, coaches, and owners took a knee on Sunday and Monday. We applaud the NFL players for taking a stand against the rhetoric of Donald Trump.

The focus for Friday’s protest isn’t about Trump though, it is about the treatment of Black men and women in america, whether it’s from systemic racism, or violence and murder by police officers without impunity. So tomorrow we ask that you join Twitterdom and take a knee at 1:00 pm EST no matter where you are. Take a knee and say the names of the over 250 Black people killed by police officers in 2016. If you want, take a picture and post in on social media with #TakeAKnee and make sure to support others who are standing… or kneeling against racism.

"Your DGB for today is to help Puerto Rico.

Last week the beautiful island of Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria. Days later it is still without power and cell phone coverage. The road system is a mess, the hospitals with generators are running out of fuel and none of them have running water. The governor is calling the situation apocalyptic and warns of an impending humanitarian crisis. All of this, mind you, is occurring on an island that is part of the United States of America, to people who are Americans. While we can hardly blame anyone for being distracted by the fact that at any moment war with North Korea could break out and/or the President of the United States will drop the pretense and start Tweeting the N-word, it is time to act and help our fellow citizens in the Caribbean.

There are several things you can do:

Call or Resistbot your Congressperson and demand a Federal Aid package be assembled and passed.

Call or Resistbot your representatives and ask that the USN Comfort be sent to help.

Donate, donate donate. Many organizations and fundraisers have pledged help.

Unicef is promising to send aid to the children affected there: https://www.unicefusa.org/donate/support-unicef-usas-hurricane-relief-efforts-puerto-rico/32952

"Your DGB for today is to tweet your support for Colin Kaepernick and members of the NFL who have refused to stand for the national anthem in order to bring attention to social justice and civil rights issues.  

Read this powerful piece by Kaepernick’s teammate Eric Reid. Peaceful protest is both an important component of social change and protected by our Constitution. In addition, there is no better cause than the fight against the systemic oppression of People of Color. It is national tragedy that the current occupant of the Oval Office respects neither the cause nor the right to protest. But we can do something.

On social media, use the hashtags #TakeAKnee, #BLM, and #BlackLivesMatter. Signal boost and center the voices of the marginalized, of those protesting, of those under the thumb of oppression. We are better than our so-called leader - let’s show it.

"Your DGB for today is to contact the office of UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and let her know that climate change is real and that we need to rejoin the Paris Agreement at the UN Convention on Climate Change in November.

We have all seen the most recent destruction that nature and climate change has caused. As skin-suit-wearing Ted Cruz said yesterday at TribFest2017 “We’ve had hurricanes since the dawn of time,” which is true, but what he totally failed to mention is that hurricanes like Harvey, Irma, and Maria, are all increasing in force because of climate change.

We can’t just sit idly by anymore and no do anything about our own personal carbon footprint and we sure as hell can’t drop out of the Paris Climate Agreement. So today you’ll contact UN Ambassador Nikki Haley’s office and let her know that we believe in climate change and it’s high time we do something about it. We don’t want to just sit and watch as Puerto Rico is hit with a storm so powerful, it left atomic bomb like destruction in it’s wake. You can contact her office through this form and let it all out. You have a 2,500 character limit; plenty of space to take them to task. Now is the time to let your righteous rage flow because this earth is all we have and we have to do our damndest to protect her."
"Your DGB for today is to register your support for H.R. 2978, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2017. https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2978

Because voter suppression is somehow still a thing in freaking 2017, we need even more laws to prevent the silencing of minority voices at the polls. This is why the United States just can’t have nice things. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL-7), who also introduced this resolution, discusses voter suppression here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-election-commission-is-already-laying-the-groundwork_us_59bc010ce4b02c642e4a15f6

"Your DGB for today is to share this article about yet another police shooting, this time with an extra-disturbing twist:

Oklahoma City police recently murdered deaf man Magdiel Sanchez while onlookers yelled at them not to shoot because of his hearing status.

You may recall that, back in May, a Tulsa officer was acquitted after shooting unarmed Black man, Terence Crutcher, as he was walking away from her with his hands up. https://www.dailygrabback.com/todays-grab-1/2017/5/24/one-bad-apple

Oklahoma, like the rest of the country, has serious policing issues. Although these shootings have become commonplace, we cannot accept this as our normal. We want as much visibility for these crimes as possible. Share widely."
"Your DGB for today is to sign up with People Power.

A new grassroots initiative from the ACLU, People Power aims to mobilize the Resistance through local events, which you can find here on their map. You can also create an event to be listed on their site if you’re organizing one.

Yes, there are a lot of organizations out there to join and event calendars to check. Yes, you still need to interact with as many as possible. The anti-Orange Julius movement is huge, but we still need as many active participants as we can get.

People Power’s current focus is a voting rights initiative, with events across the country on October 1st. Keep hitting the streets, Grabbers!"
"Your DGB for today is to start following White Nonsense Roundup on social media, and either help out or make use of them, depending.

White Nonsense Roundup, recently profiled in Huffington Post, is a terrific project that allows People of Color a break from the endless job of explaining white supremacy and racism, and defending their humanity, to white people on social media. PoC can simply send out a bat signal by tagging @nowhitenonsense on Twitter or @whitenonsenseroundup on Facebook, and white volunteers will show up to do the job. White people have a responsibility to be actively anti-racist, and this is one way they can do just that. The volunteers will take the heat, engage in discussion, and dispatch trolls where necessary.

How many days without white nonsense? That’s right - zero. So get out there, white folk, and get to work. And friends of color, please kick back and have a pumpkin spice latte. You’ve more than earned it."
"Your DGB for today is to call out a crisis pregnancy center.

If you are at all familiar with the anti-choice movement in the U.S., you know that they will stop at pretty much nothing to push their agenda. Whether it’s faking videos, faking aborted fetus pictures, or faking abortion clinics, they ruthlessly pursue their goal of restricting rights and access to abortion AND birth control. Because apparently the treatment of endometriosis makes baby Jesus sad… or something. One of their most egregious tactics is the use of the so-called “crisis pregnancy center” that masquerades as a an actual medical clinic offering services to pregnant women, but is really there to shame women out of getting abortions.

This DGB is courtesy of ExposeFakeClinics.com. They help to identify the jerks and call them out publicly via Yelp or other review sites. Check out the steps they lay out and get to work following them.

Grab back and help women spot a fraud!"
"Your DGB for today is to (once again) call your Senators and tell them to vote NO on the GOP’s latest version of a health care bill.

Republicans, those wascally wabbits, are still trying to make repeal and replace a “thing.”  Like the other bills the GOP has tried to pass this year, Graham-Cassidy would gut medicare, defund Planned Parenthood, spike premiums, and cause millions of people to lose insurance over the next ten years. This bill may be the most draconian of all the Trumpcare versions we’ve seen so far. It seems incredible, since the others were so bad, but this is far worse.

So, kids, you know what to do: Fire up Resistbot, your phone, or heck, even a raven, and tell your Senators to take a hard pass on Graham-Cassidy. Get your mom and your neighbors to do it too.  And please hurry - Congress wants to pass this by the end of September.

"
"Your DGB for today is to help victims of Hurricane Irma.

Hurricane Irma devastated the Caribbean Islands, as well as Florida, and other southern states. Some islands are completely uninhabitable and will take years to recover and rebuild.

Today, we want you to find some small way to contribute to rebuilding the Caribbean Islands and the southern states affected by Irma. One of the easiest ways to help is by donating to the Red Cross. They are one of the biggest relief organizations and have the ability to get aid on the ground immediately. You can donate to them here: https://www.redcross.org/donate/hurricane-irma-donations

Retired NBA superstar Tim Duncan has also set up a campaign to donate money to the islands, as he was born and raised in the US Virgin Islands and felt the affects of Hurricane Hugo as a kid. You can donate to his campaign here: https://www.youcaring.com/21usvirginislandrelieffund-942738

And as always during a natural disaster, local blood banks are in desperate need of donations. Even if your area wasn’t personally affected, a natural disaster can tax all local clinics. If you’re eligible, grab a friend and spend 20 minutes donating at your local clinic. You yours here: http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx

Unfortunately, natural disasters are starting to feel like the norm, and DGB understands how taxing they are. Now is the time to come together and show that there is good in this country, and we will continue to work together, despite weak and unpredictable leadership."
"Your DGB for today is to send a postcard or thank you note to House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi.

Nancy Pelosi has been getting shit done in DC since the early 80s and right wingers absolutely hate her for it. She has been called every name in the book, like most women in power, and continues to hold her head high and get the work done. Recently, she has even been able to get Trump to do what she wants to do. She is currently working on a DACA bill, that doesn’t include funding for the archaic wall. And a little over a week ago, in a move that stunned republicans, Pelosi and Schumer struck a budget deal with Trump.

We want you to send your love to Pelosi. Who doesn’t love to get thanks for doing the hard work? Print up one of DGB’s postcards, or write her a thank you note and tell her how much you appreciate what she is doing.

 

Her mailing address is:

"Your DGB for today is to call your Member of Congress and tell them to vote against H.R. 620, which would be a nightmare for disabled Americans.

We swear, sometimes it seems like the GOP just looks for vulnerable populations to kick around. This time, it’s disabled Americans just trying to get through their days with dignity and a modicum of self-reliance.  H.R. 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act of 2017, would upend the Americans with Disabilities Act’s current requirement that businesses proactively make efforts to comply with the ADA. Instead, according to the ACLU, “This bill proposes that after an individual with a disability is denied access she must first notify the business owner, with exacting specificity, that her civil rights were violated, and then wait for six months to see if the business will make ‘substantial progress’ toward access, before going to a court to order compliance.” The burden would be on the disabled, not business. Not only is this grossly unfair, but it also completely subverts the entire purpose of the ADA.

If you do not yet have your Members of Congress and Senators on speed-dial, you can use Resistbot or Countable to register your horror at this latest attempt to erode our civil liberties."
"Your DGB for today is to support ESPN reporter, Jemele Hill.

If you haven’t been on twitter lately, or heard any news, you might not have heard the controversy surrounding the ESPN reporter, Jemele Hill. On 9/11/2017 Hill tweeted that Donald Trump was a white supremacist. I mean...the statement isn’t a lie, and since then people have been coming hard for her. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders even went as far as to say that it was a fire-able offense and that Hill should lose her job with ESPN. The president even did some early morning tweeting regarding this issue because he's a small, fragile man. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/908651641943003136

What we want you to do today is to express your support for Jemele Hill. You can either retweet her or tweet your support out to her. You can find the painfully truthful tweet here: https://twitter.com/jemelehill/status/907391978194849793 You can also contact ESPN and urge them to back her a little harder than they are right now. Another option is to start watching her on ESPN’s SportsCenter at 6:00 pm.

Donald Trump is a white supremacist. People shouldn’t lose their jobs or have their lives threatened for speaking the truth. We need more people like Jemele Hill, so stand up and support her so others feel encouraged to come forward."
"Your DGB for today is to oppose the nomination of Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) to lead NASA.

Jim has most of the regressive requirements for being tapped by Trump for an administrative position, such as xenophobia and an inability to accept empirical evidence, so it’s easy to see why Trump likes him.

Here’s a handy list of the terrible things Bridenstine has said about the LGBTQ+ community over the years: https://www.glaad.org/tap/jim-bridenstine

Here’s a fun interview in which he talks out of an alternate orifice about climate science: http://www.omagdigital.com/publication/?i=307413&article_id=2500588&view=articleBrowser&ver=html5#{%22issue_id%22:307413,%22view%22:%22articleBrowser%22,%22article_id%22:%222500588%22}

"Your DGB for today is to recycle some markers.

If your house is anything like this DGB writer’s, you will agree that markers have a short life span. A child leaves the cap off after a single use, drying up the colorful lifeblood. An adult finds evidence of a marker on a wall or furniture or baby’s leg and throws out every marker in the house in a fit of rage. But yet markers’ usefulness for both brightly tinted coloring projects and writing reminders on the family whiteboard that your spouse will ignore are unquestionable. The thing is that Mother Earth, like most mothers, doesn’t want your ding dang markers either.

Did you know that markers are recyclable? You can take them apart and recycle the tube and cap through your area recycling program. Crayola and Prang both have recycle programs for their marker products. Check them out here, http://www.crayola.com/colorcycle.aspx, and here, http://www.dixonrecycle.com. If you want to recycle some other brand like Sharpie, Terracycle is here for you: http://www.terracycle.com/en-US/zero_waste_boxes/pens-pencils-and-markers.

Grab back and keep markers out of landfills."
"Your DGB for today is to register your objection with the National Archives and Records Administration for their decision to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to destroy important records as a matter of course.  

As the ACLU says, “Destroying records effectively grants ICE impunity for its abuses, makes it harder for the public to hold ICE accountable in the future, and erases important parts of the historical record.”

This proposed move is par for the course for an administration that has systematically acted to make the country less safe for women, people of color, and other vulnerable populations. And when this same administration aims to detain more immigrants than ever, it’s never been more critical to resist this decision.

Show NARA and ICE that Americans insist our government be accountable and transparent. We don’t want to hear the sound of shredders working overtime in federal detention facilities."
"Your DGB for today is to watch the trailer for the new Time multimedia project called Firsts. http://time.com/watch-the-trailer-for-time-firsts/

In addition to watching the trailer, we want you to help them find other women who have been firsts. You can share stories on social media using #SheIsTheFirst. Are you the first female mayor of your town? Were you the first female executive at your company? First female in your family to attend college? You may be featured.

Watch the trailer, send them your stories, and get inspired to do more. We still have so many glass ceilings to shatter. Let's do it together."
"Your DGB for today is to publicly shame the Las Vegas Police Department for their treatment of Michael Bennett.

In an August 26th incident at a Las Vegas nightclub, the Seahawks Defensive End was handcuffed, threatened, and assaulted by Las Vegas Metro PD officers. After hearing what most assumed were gunshots, Bennett and others ran for safety, which officers apparently decided was some sort of admission of guilt. There wasn’t actually a shooting that day, just your usual law enforcement profiling and excessive force. Bennett has stated that an officer held a gun to his head and said he would “blow my fucking head off.” Read his statement here: https://twitter.com/mosesbread72?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor

Not only does the department stand by the actions of their officers, they actually had the nerve to ask the NFL to investigate Bennett for false allegations in a letter which included the following:

 

""While the NFL may condone Bennett's disrespect for our American Flag, and everything it symbolizes, we hope the League will not ignore Bennett's false accusations against our police officers.""

 

(Bennett, among other NFL players, has declined to stand during the national anthem.) But sure… it’s not about race. Commissioner Roger Goodell refused the request and instead released a statement standing by his players. https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-rejects-las-vegas-police-union-request-wont-investigate-michael-bennett/

Today, you’ll tweet the Las Vegas Metro PD @LVMPD to let them know we see their racism and overreach. Here’s a DGB sample tweet:

 

.@LVMPD Your treatment of @mosesbread72 during and after the 8/26 incident is disgusting, racist, and unacceptable. Apologize now.

"Your DGB for today is to oppose the nomination of Eric Dreiband to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

As we’ve come to expect, Trump has nominated yet another unqualified individual whose career appears antithetical to the position needing to be filled. Besides being a privileged white dude, Dreiband spent much of his career at Jones Day defending corporations from employment discrimination lawsuits. You know, helping the real underdogs in America.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-dreiband-doj-civil-rights-trump_us_59b0230be4b0b5e53102fb4a

The Senate Judiciary Committee questioned him on Wednesday in a rushed session, barely having enough time to scratch the surface of his views and record. He managed to denounce the KKK, but unless this guy is going to break with his spectacularly xenophobic boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, on pretty much every other issue, he’s not the person to head the Civil Rights Division.

You’ll contact your Senators using Resistbot or Countable and tell them the Civil Rights Division isn’t actually for dividing up Civil Rights."

"Your DGB for today is to support organizations that in turn support Dreamers.

Taking a break from the laborious tasks of incoherent Tweeting, speaking at self-serving rallies, and pretending to load pickup truck cabs with hurricane-relief supplies, our President recently announced his intentions for the future of DACA. Yesterday we asked you to contact Congress and get their help protecting Dreamers. Today we would like you to help those that are going to be on the front lines defending those Dreamers and be prepared to share information with anyone who needs it.

We have compiled a list of organizations that provide legal help and other resources here:

https://www.dailygrabback.com/immigration-resources/. Please find one that you can support. Also, please update your personal resource list with immigration help resources so you can connect those that will need it.

Grab back and preserve a dream!"
"Your DGB for today is to contact your Member of Congress and tell him or her you want Congress to protect “Dreamers” when Trump ends DACA.

True to form, Trump has signaled that he’s going to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. This Obama-era immigration policy was designed to protect and aid undocumented immigrants who came here as kids. Since the current occupant of the Oval Office seems to want to undo everything good that #44 did, we are dismayed, but not surprised. 

In the wake of this news, Congress has a chance to pass legislation that will address the same issue. We need Republicans and Democrats to work together on this.

Please also check out Daily Grab Back’s demonstration calendar for upcoming protests regarding the cancellation of DACA."
"Your DGB for today is to give directly to Black women affected by Hurricane Harvey.

The scope of devastation of Hurricane Harvey is just starting to come to light and estimates put damage costs at around $190 million dollars; that’s more than Katrina. When disasters like this happen, women, especially minorities, are often overlooked or forgotten and don’t receive as much aid as others, if any.

This is where #SupportBlackWomenHOU enters. It was started by Roni Dean Burren, a local Houston educator, lecturer, and activist. Burren is looking to fill the gap in the lack of help that many women of color face during a crisis or natural disaster. Spend some time going over their list and donating directly where you can. You can find the list here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTNx4hHMBXypaACxUFy2-Rqr4ITfCTWbH5IWRUKIDUwa9wUYG_-iS_Ggqz_B2pHaIIEW59rNfNgvZAv/pub They also provide a link for Black women in Houston to apply for assistance through this program.

And if you were one of the fortunate that procured a pair of the special glasses allowing you to stare into the sun without being blinded (hopefully you had the common sense to keep them on…) you may be wondering what to do with them now.

The organizations Astronomers Without Borders and Explore Scientific have collaborated to set up glasses donation centers throughout the country. They will be sending them to schools in South America and Asia for use during the eclipse those continents will experience in 2019. You can read more about this initiative here: http://astronomerswithoutborders.org/awb-programs/resource-sharing-programs/eclipse-glasses-donation-program.html

And use their handy interactive map here to find a nearby donation station: http://astronomerswithoutborders.org/awb-programs/resource-sharing-programs/eclipse-glasses-donation-program/glasses-collection-centers.html

Don’t be an astronomical jerk, share your glasses with some schoolkids!"
"Your DGB for today is to call your representatives and tell them that you support Rep. Adam Schiff’s amendment that would stop the Secret Service from paying any business owned or operated by Trump.

Trump is no King Midas and all his weekend golfing and vacations at his own properties are eating up the funds Secret Service funds for protecting the President. More than 1,000 of their agents have hit their salary cap that is supposed to last the entire year. And because it is the United States’ responsibility to provide protection for the President and his family, many agents are going to have to keep doing their job without getting paid.

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, might have a solution. Since many of the trips benefit Trump, not only personally, but also financially, why don’t we cut off the funds he would get from the Secret Service having to pay for staying in his hotels, resorts, and even paying for the use of his golf carts? The SS has had to fork over 60,000 dollars alone just to rent golf carts at the President’s personal golf courses in order to keep up with his weekend addiction. Contact your Reps and tell them enough is enough. The President of the Unites States should not be padding his bank account, all while those who are sworn to protect him aren’t getting paid.  "
"Your DGB for today is to sign up to receive emails from the Clinton Health Matters Initiative.

Today is International Overdose Awareness Day, which makes it a great day to get involved in reducing prescription drug abuse and saving the lives of those battling an addiction. One of the great things CHMI tackles is distribution of naloxone (Narcan) to community groups, educational institutions, and public safety organizations. Both sites also have a donation option.

If you or someone you know is living with an addiction, please also check out DGB’s Health and Mental Health Resources list. "
"Your DGB for today is to send some supplies to a sailor on the high seas.

On August 21, 2017, the USS John S. McCain collided with a merchant ship, leaving ten dead or missing and five injured. It goes without saying that our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of those sailors.

You can do more than just send good thoughts and prayers for those affected by this disaster, though. You can send needed items to those sailors that lost all of their their material possessions in the accident. If you’re not in a position to send goods, send a note of condolences.

"Your DGB for today is to join Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America in sending or personally delivering a postcard to your Congress Member telling them you oppose the NRA’s “Concealed Carry Reciprocity” Legislation.

The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is being pushed by the NRA and forces states to recognize other states’ concealed carry permits. This will put more firearms into cities and states that have strict gun laws and “remove local governments’ ability to maintain sensible gun standards and keep a proper vetting process in place.”


Today we want you to send a postcard or hand deliver one to your Congress Member and let them know you will not support this bill and you don’t want the NRA influencing our nation’s laws and policies. You can search for a local event here: http://act.everytown.org/event/ccr-postcard-delivery/ and you can even use DGB’s official post card."
"Your DGB for today is to subscribe to Wake Up To Politics, the daily email newsletter from progressive policy prodigy, Gabe Fleisher.

Think back to high school...what were you doing in the mornings? Admit it, you were hitting the snooze button ten times. Or maybe you had an early sports practice. But you probably weren’t composing a highly detailed, timely, and well-written summary of the previous day’s politics. High school student Gabe Fleisher does, though. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/style/gabe-fleisher-wake-up-to-politics-newsletter.html?_r=0

He’s been writing a daily newsletter since he was… wait for it… EIGHT YEARS OLD. This kid is amazing. He’s a high school freshman and he has a blue check on Twitter.

So cut through the junk on facebook and twitter, and sign up for the Wake Up to Politics. It’s a great way to get good, solid news and support interest in progressive politics in young people.

Your new morning routine: Read your WUTP newsletter, do your Daily Grab Back, and smile knowing that you’re educated, active, and doing your part.

"Your DGB for today is to tell Amazon to stop advertising on Breitbart. According to the Sierra Club, over 2,000 companies have stopped buying ads on the hateful fake news site. It’s time for Amazon, the largest retailer, to take a stand.

We won’t tell you to read any of the bigoted and misogynistic articles on Breitbart, but just the titles of some of the “greatest hits” should give you a sense: “Suck It Up Buttercups: Dangerous Faggot Tour Returns to Colleges in September,” and “There’s No Hiring Bias Against Women in Tech: They Just Suck at Interviews.”

"Your DGB for today is to oppose Trump’s nomination of Sam Clovis to head the USDA.

There’s unqualified, and then way past that line, there’s Sam Clovis. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2017/08/15/reject-this-incompetent-trump-appointee-hes-not-a-scientist/#2c516cd017b1

Yep, he’s xenophobic to the extreme. He’s a birther, climate change denier, suggested Obama got into Ivy League schools because of his race, called Eric Holder “a racist Black,” and is a big fan of the marriage equality = pedophilia slippery slope argument. That’s all pretty terrible, but he’s also not a scientist. A 2008 law gives guidance for picking a USDA head from a pool of “distinguished scientists with specialized or significant experience in agricultural research, education and economics.”

Clovis is a former right wing talk show host, which makes him about as qualified to be the Department of Agriculture’s head scientist as your average toddler. Letting this dude head the USDA would be like letting a reality show star be president of the United States. Imagine how that would turn out.

Use Resistbot or Countable to register your disgust with your Senators."
"Your DGB for today is to follow Sleeping Giants.

Dedicated to drying up ad dollars for regressive websites, Sleeping Giants has a Facebook page and Twitter account, both of which mobilize crowds to act as reporters, letting companies know when their ads are appearing on problematic sites.

 

https://www.facebook.com/slpnggiants/

https://twitter.com/slpng_giants

 

They’re currently going hard for Breitbart, which we at DGB love. Presently, over 225 advertisers have pulled their ads from Steve Bannon’s pet project. But Sleeping Giants also goes after lesser known sites spewing hate. Without private sponsorship, we think they have a real chance of tanking many of these sites altogether.

An important thing to remember is that many smaller companies are unaware their ads are running on racist, sexist, xenophobic media sites, but they are able to block their ads once they realize it. For this reason, SG has had a lot of luck using an initial polite approach. Other companies have been made aware and still have not pulled their ads, which we will be tackling in future Grabs.

"Your DGB for today is to consider boycotting the NFL.

Last year, San Francisco 49’ers quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, drew attention for choosing to kneel during the National Anthem. His reason was a protest of police brutality in addition to the song being a racist holdover from slavery days. (He’s correct; check out the cringeworthy backstory here.) Kaepernick became a free agent in the spring of 2017 and as of today has still not been signed onto an NFL team. According to FiveThirtyEight, that is the longest time that a player of his abilities has been unemployed, ever. Contrast that with the long and befuddling list of rapists, domestic abusers, animal torturers, and terrible players that DO have NFL jobs. Excuses for his lack of contract are no less confusing and include his vegan diet and his haircut.

This comes with the recent findings regarding brain damage suffered from years of professional football play and facts that point to Black players being particularly at risk.

Folks, it’s time that we demand better treatment of those working so hard to entertain us. The camel’s back is as broken as it needs to be - it’s time to take a stand. Use your valuable viewing eyes to catch up on some Netflix, and use your fan dollars to support Colin Kaepernick (merchandise available here) and other players joining him in protest.

Grab back and demand better for our teams."
"Your DGB for today is to sign this petition to replace the Confederate statues in Portsmouth, Virginia with one of Missy “Misdemeanor” Elliott.

If there is one good thing that’s come out of the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, VA this month, it’s that public sentiment has finally turned against having statues in parks and government buildings that glorify the Confederacy, and all over the country these statues are being taken down. They should never have been put up in the first place, so this is long overdue. It’s only natural that we start to think about who should stand in their place. To be reminded of just why Missy is an excellent candidate to be memorialized thusly (and how unparalleled her style is), check out this article and photo-spread Elle magazine did on the hip-hop legend earlier this year.

After you’re done signing that petition, consider the Confederate statues in your own city. If there are no plans to take them down, call up your mayor and ask why, fortheloveofGod, NOT? If there are plans, consider starting your own petition for worthy replacements. Wouldn’t it be fitting and delightful, not to mention a big f-u to the Nazis, if all the General Lees and Stonewall Jacksons were replaced with statues of Black Americans? Yeah, we think so, too. Supa Dupa Fly."
"Your DGB for today is to help save DACA and its Dreamers.

Trump and his ilk may not like it, but the United States is a nation of immigrants. Immigrants make us a better country. Trump is threatening to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and the results would be disastrous. 800,000 young people currently have work permits and protection under DACA. These young people have lived most of their lives in the United States. They have jobs, they pay taxes, they own homes, they make purchases, they contribute to our economy every day. DACA is thought to be one of Obama’s greatest programs, so it’s no wonder Trump wants to do away with it.

Today we want you to check out America’s Voice and learn more about the DACA program. If you are able, contribute funds to help them. If you can’t contribute, there are many other things you can do, like contacting your state’s Attorney General and telling them to uphold DACA. You can also host a Dreamer dinner or call your senators and tell them to protect DACA from Trump. There’s even a section where you can tell your own personal Dreamer story. However you choose to help DACA, spend some time browsing the website. They have interactive videos, personal stories, and a section called Immigration 101 to inform on a variety of subjects, such as what exactly a Dreamer is, and what rights ICE has to deport people.

America has become the beautiful melting pot of culture it is today because of immigration. It is a nation founded on immigration and on the principles that immigrants are not only allowed here, but welcomed. Do what you can to uphold those beliefs and values and support DACA."
"Your DGB for today is to connect with Nice White Ladies. https://www.nicewhiteladies.com/

You can donate to an emergency reparations fund, deal with your white feelings in their secret facebook group, volunteer skills matching, and access other resources they amplify, such as Safety Pin Box.

"Your DGB for today is to partner up with Life After Hate and help end the cycle of extremism and hatred that is overtaking our country.

Life After Hate is a non-profit organization that was founded by former members of violent far-right extremist groups. Their mission is to work with individuals and communities to end intolerance and hatred. They offer a variety of services like https://www.exitusa.org/, which works directly with individuals who wish to disengage from the white power movement. They also offer addiction counseling, community outreach, and education programs to help rehabilitate those who have been indoctrinated and radicalized by far-right hatred and racism.

Life After Hate is the only organization outside of the FBI that is working to extract people from hate groups. They were awarded a $400,000 grant from the Obama administration, but Trump decided he was not going to honor that grant. Weird that a Nazi sympathizer doesn’t want to end the cycle of hatred and violence…

This is where you come in. Life After Hate is quickly losing funds and they are looking to crowdfund. Samantha Bee recently learned about them and is working to get the word out, and we want to help. You can learn more about their organization, as well as get the link to their crowdfunding campaign in this article. Can’t directly donate? Select them for your Amazon Smile donation and give back while shopping.

Team up with the brilliant Samantha Bee,  Daily Grab Back, and Life After Hate to end the cycle of extremism and hatred."
"Your DGB for today is to donate to GiveDirectly. 

Their business model is so simple, it takes you by surprise: how about we just give people who are poor actual money?

http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/08/07/541609649/how-to-fix-poverty-why-not-just-give-people-money

Charities usually have some sort of clever way of distributing help to the needy, which is great, but we at DGB kind of adore this idea of just providing people with a basic income. With their ongoing 12 year study, they hope to gather not just long-term data on individual households, but also the macroeconomic impact of moving money into communities that need it.

GiveDirectly uses electronic funds to give income to people living in the developing world. They’re currently working extensively in Kenya and are close to their fundraising goal. Let’s push them over that amount.

Give money to people who need it. Genius."
"Your DGB for today is to find out if Republicans in your state are trying to pass laws protecting terrorists like James Field; and if they are, to call your lawmakers about it.

We are all still reeling from the events in Charlottesville, VA, especially the death of Heather Heyer and the injury of 19 others, who were all plowed into by a white supremacist terrorist with a driver’s license. When this method (vehicle-on-pedestrian) has been used by ISIS to kill and disrupt, politicians in the United States are lightning-quick to condemn. But, as we speak, GOP lawmakers in six states are actually trying to pass laws that actually protect drivers who hit pedestrian protesters. Yep. And if you are wondering what might motivate the “party of Lincoln” to do such a thing, look no further than the rise of Black Lives Matter and the anti-Trump resistance. Apparently the GOP doesn’t care if dissent gets mowed down in the street.

If you are a voter in Florida, North Dakota, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, or Texas, get ahold of your state representative and give him or her a piece of your mind. If you aren’t in one of those states, you might still live in a state that is cracking down on protesting in other ways. Find out, and speak out. Peaceful protest should be protected and no one should lose their life because they chose to exercise their rights."
"Your DGB for today is to check out Stacey Abrams, fall as in love with her as we have, and support her in any way that you can.

Stacey Abrams is a serious breath of fresh air in stagnant white male political scene. She is running for Governor of Georgia and when (we can’t even think about if) she wins, she will not only be the first female Governor of Georgia, but she will be the first black female Governor of any state in the US. You can learn more about Stacey on her website, but we also suggest you listen to her guest appearance on Hellbent Podcast: Episode 46.

Once you have gotten to know Stacey, we want you to help her get elected. You can do that by getting the word out about her, donating to her campaign, or volunteering. You can sign up to volunteer for her here: https://secure.staceyabrams.com/page/s/Volunteer. They are looking for people to knock on doors, make phone calls, host a party, be a digital ambassador, or anything you could think of to help get the word out.

Support Stacey Abrams and encourage more women to run for office. Hell, if you can, run for office yourself! We have Donald Trump as President; anyone can win."
"Your DGB for today is to go to this Twitter thread, pick a good cause in Charlottesville, VA, and make a material donation as a stand against the hate we’ve seen there this week. 

On Friday and Saturday, unabashed and unashamed racist hatemongers took to the streets of Charlottesville, VA to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate leader, General Robert E. Lee.  Scores of people were injured, and one counter-protester was killed by a terrorist mowing down people in the street. Despite the argument that Confederate statues represent “Southern pride” and not white supremacy, we note that those agitating for the statues to remain were carrying flags with swastikas on them, shouting Nazi slogans, and throwing up the Nazi straight-arm salute.

We also note that those irritating red MAGA hats made an appearance on the heads of white supremacists marching, some shouted “Heil Trump”, and that former KKK grand wizard David Duke specifically said he was marching in Donald Trump’s name. Before pandering to these deplorables, the President should’ve listened to Fox Mulder, who once wisely asked “Did you really think you could call up the devil and expect him to behave?”

While Trump and his followers have made being openly racist “cool” again, they did not invent racism. It’s been here the whole time, ever since this country was founded on stolen land and built with kidnapping and enslavement. Not that it *ever* was, but this is NO TIME to sit on the sidelines. Stand up against institutional racism, micro-aggressions, white supremacy, white privilege, and all that messy, ugly stuff. After you donate to a Charlottesville organization, look around you at your own family, your community, and yourself and ask: how can you make a change?"
"Your DGB for today is to disseminate the findings of the Police Use Of Force Project.

In particular, police departments with more restrictive use of force policies enjoy a lower rate of assault on officers, including fewer officers being killed in the line of duty. More statistics and analysis can be found on their website, but DGB thinks this particular one has broad and bipartisan appeal. Share with your social media circle, use it in debate, bring it up over dinner."
"Your DGB for today is to take this quiz to see if you would qualify to immigrate to the United States under Trump’s new merit based immigration bill.

Donald Trump, along with Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR) and David Perdue (R-GA), can’t wait to upend United States immigration policy. Planned changes would halve green cards issued per year and use some pretty bizarre measurements to judge your value as an immigrant/human being. lf you’ve won an olympic medal, you get 25 points! In order to immigrate here, you would have to meet the minimum of 30 points. (Heads up- DGB staff did not do well. Sad!) Read more about the bill here: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/2/trump-backs-immigration-bill-cut-green-card-limits/

Today we want you to take the quiz and share your results with us, as well as your friends. Get the word out that this proposed law is pretty damn classist, as well as cruel, as it also plans to limit permanent resident refugees down to 50,000 a year. The White House says that number is right in line with yearly averages, but this graph from Pew Research begs to differ.

Stephen Miller may not believe in the poem on the Statue of Liberty, but DGB does."
"Your DBG for today is to help erase school lunch debt.

Despite the fact that summer sun and heat is still blazing, kids are heading back to school or will be within a few weeks. For the fellow parents of school age children out there: Congratulations, you made it! Whether you are a parent, non-parent, grandparent, generally fear and avoid children, or all of the above, we can all agree that hungry children and stressed parents are a bad combination for learning and growth. That’s why we love the public school lunch program. Feeding hungry kids is an absolute good. Public school lunch programs do it cheaply and well, providing food to 30 million kids of all incomes across the country.

Cheap does not equal free, however. School lunches are free to those that fall below certain income levels, but still cost money for those that don’t qualify. When you’re living on an income between poor and comfortable, that ~$2 a day adds up, especially if you have multiple children. When parents fall behind on paying for lunches, most schools continue to feed kids. Over time, this creates a deficit, causing problems for both the school and parents.

It’s simple and inexpensive to help with this situation. Just donate at least $2 to your local school for use on an overdrawn lunch account. Use this link to find your local school:  https://www.greatschools.org/school-district-boundaries-map/, then call or email them to say you want to help with payoff of an overdue lunch bill.

"Your DGB for today is to send POTUS a postcard from your corner of the United States, to remind him to have just a crumb of pride for the country he is supposed to represent on the world stage.

#45 has always made his disdain for our country and it’s people quite clear. His inauguration speech described the US as some kind of post-apocalyptic wasteland. Recent transcripts of a call Trump made to Mexico’s president back in January show that he referred to New Hampshire as a “drug-infested den.” And finally, it was revealed this month that our President told a bunch of fellow golfers at his course in Bedminster, NJ, that the White House is “a real dump.” Yes, really. 

We know our country has its share of problems. We even concede there may be plumbing issues at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But, come on - show a little respect for America, Donny.

If you would like to let POTUS know what our country is truly like, please send a postcard depicting the best your city or state has to offer, to:

 

The White House

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, DC 20500

 

Please also consider posting a pic of your postcard on social media with the hashtag, #postcardsfromUS."
"Your DGB for today is to help replace a Confederate statue with a manatee.

Okay, okay, not a real manatee. And not just any manatee either.

If you don’t live near Bradenton, Florida, you may not have heard of Snooty the Manatee, in which case you’re missing out. Snooty was born in captivity in 1948, and lived at The South Florida Museum until July 23, 2017, when he drowned in a tragic aquarium accident. The official mascot of greater Manatee County, Florida, Snooty was adored locally, but also contributed greatly to manatee research over the course of his 69 years on Earth. He was believed to be the oldest living manatee and the only captive manatee to have regular human contact. During events held at the South Florida Museum, he would press his face to the adjoining glass aquarium wall in the courtyard, socializing with the crowds.

A few blocks away from Snooty’s lifelong home stands the Manatee County Courthouse, in front of which there is a monument to fallen confederate soldiers (to be fair, there were a LOT of those), even depicting a rebel flag at it’s base. Shortly after the news of Snooty’s passing, lifelong fan, Anthony Pusateri, began a petition to relocate the current offensive statue and replace it with one memorializing Snooty. It was delivered to the Manatee County Commission last week with nearly 13,000 signatures.

Anthony clearly isn’t alone. In fact, the Commissioner representing District Two and Bradenton, Charles Smith, has suggested Gamble Plantation as a final resting place for the statue of poor taste. (DGB was thinking the nearest dump would work, but we’ll yield to Commissioner Smith.)

Today, you’ll contact the Chairman of the Commission and urge her to proceed on the matter. Here’s a sample script:


 

As “The Friendly City”, Bradenton deserves to have something that makes people smile in front of the aptly-named Manatee County Courthouse. It’s time to remove the unwelcoming and divisive confederate statue and replace it with a likeness of dearly-departed, lettuce-loving Snooty.

"Your DGB for today is to start promoting the next ACA open enrollment period.

In lieu of being able to pass any Obamacare repeal through his Republican-controlled Congress, Trump will now rely on his ongoing fallback strategy: sabotaging it in every possible way to further the propaganda that it’s failing. This New York Times article explains his plan well.

One of the things he did back in January was pull advertising and outreach for the remainder of that open enrollment period (It ended January 31, 2017). The ACA needs more participation to work better, especially from the young and healthy, so promotion is key. The next open enrollment period begins November 1, 2017, and we need to let absolutely everyone know. If the government isn’t going to advertise, we the people will spread the word. Share this grab, share the ACA website- just get it out there.

"Your DGB for today is to promote diversity and participation in clinical research.

We here at the DGB love diversity. And not just because of its popularity as a progressive buzzword in the 1990s, although we love the 90s too. Diversity makes the world a better, stronger, and more interesting place. It also makes it a healthier one. Unfortunately, due to various aspects of racism, sexism, and white supremacy, the lack of diversity in clinical trials and research has had a real and dangerous impact on the efficacy of medication and medical procedures.

As noted in the link, there are a number of reasons for this problem. Medical science has a long and sordid history of doing pretty much everything wrong when it comes to ethical behavior. Lack of access to medical care has a disproportionate effect on minorities and women. Sometimes it’s simply a knowledge gap. People don’t realize that they are needed to participate. Today, consider volunteering for a clinical trial and/or at least seeing if you are a good match for one. You don’t have to be suffering from a medical condition or have a complicated genetic history - healthy people are needed too!

ResearchMatch is an organization funded mostly by the National Institute of Health (NIH) that has set up a database and matching system to pair volunteers with trials that need them. Set up a profile and lend your body to science!"
"Your DGB for today is to read about, absorb, and incorporate reproductive justice into your feminism. 

In the US, especially among white women, we tend to frame issues of reproductive rights/equality as a matter of “choice” - that is, the legal right to choose an abortion if we wish it, and to a lesser extent, access to birth control. Reproductive justice looks at the issue of reproduction in terms of social justice. It asks questions such as, what does “choice” mean when Black women who choose to carry to term face higher rates of maternal mortality? What does “choice” mean when women of color bring home significantly less money than white women, and are more likely to have jobs that don’t offer parental leave? What does the choice to have a baby mean for mothers fearful their children will grow up to be hurt or killed by police? Reproductive justice puts the fight for choice in a much larger context.

"Your DGB for today is to help protect the LGBTQ+ community from Trump’s horrific regime.

Wednesday produced an endless stream of horrific news that sends our country's progress in equality back a decade. First, Trump tweeted out some semi-coherent crap about kicking trans men and women out of the military. Then, later that night we heard that the Department of Justice weighed in on a case they weren’t even involved in to say that sexual discrimination in the workplace is ONLY discrimination if it’s because the person is male or female, and if they happen to be fired because they are gay, well then, they are just shit out of luck.

What we want you to do today is to stand with our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters and do everything we can to fight against Trump’s plans to undo all of Obama’s work. If you haven’t already, become a card carrying member of the ACLU. Their website also includes a petition to sign to protect our Trans Servicemembers. You can also refer to our previous Grab about how to support the community by flying the rainbow flag in your yard or getting a Hate Has No Home Here sign.

Whatever you do, we all need to be ready to go to bat for our friends, loved ones, and ourselves. It is a non-stop deluge of awful news, but we have to tell them “Not today. Not ever.”

"
"Your DGB for today is to send good ol’ Turtle McConnell your deepest condolences on the failure of his precious health care bill.

The roller coaster is currently over and Mitch McConnell’s horrific health care bill has finally failed. Don’t let this rapture fool you into thinking we don’t have to keep fighting, but, for August recess, we can breathe a sigh of relief and participate in some schadenfreude.

All we are asking you to do today is to participate in some humble bragging that the bill died. We have created a handy-dandy postcard for you to print and send to Mean Girl Mitch. Why not send one to each and every one of his offices? If you really feel like gloating, you can also give him a call, e-mail, or engage in some good old-fashioned twitter trolling @SenateMajLdr.

No matter what you choose to do, please make sure your condolences are dripping with sarcasm."
"Your DGB for today is to observe World Hepatitis Day.

Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver caused by a virus and it's a worldwide epidemic, killing about as many people each year as HIV/AIDS, with 80-90% of those infected unaware of their status. Hepatitis A and E are spread mainly by contaminated water, while B and C are primarily contracted by blood to blood contact.

The best ways to help eradicate these viruses are to vaccinate our children, support clean needle programs, and conserve and protect water, all things which are regressing under our Trumptatorship.

These types of activism also help to control, prevent, and extinguish many other types of disease. So, unless enough people start to care about these causes, we are probably all going to die soon. Enjoy your weekend!"
"Your DGB for today is to check out the Hellbent podcast. 

This podcast was created by Sarah Lerner, creator of @IfHillaryHad, featuring tweets from an alternate reality where Hillary is the 45th president of the United States, and Devon Handy, who are childhood friends. They break down politics with a conversational, feminist edge and a million “fuck”s. Note: they don’t give any passes to Bernie Bros."
"Your DGB for today is to help send a kid to camp.

Whether it be band, drama, 4H or just regular, summer camp is a fun tradition. It allows kids to build new friendships, learn new things and spend large amounts of time outside. For Lindsay Lohan and Haley Mills, it even meant reuniting with your long-lost twin sister that your parents had inexplicably separated you from, following a presumably nasty divorce. That you didn’t even know happened. But we digress. At any rate camp can be a truly magical experience that is too often reserved for kids of parents able to shell out several hundred dollars. Opportunities to expand horizons and be part of a community should be for everyone.

Today, we ask that you consider making a small donation to help support a program that sends children from low income families to camp experiences. We have listed a few below.

 

Happy Camper Foundation (South Florida): http://happy-camper.org/index.html

"Your DGB for today is to contact the Boy Scouts and let them know that playing along with Donald J. Trump’s shenanigans is unacceptable.

At a Jamboree on Monday, POTUS addressed the Scouts as they’ve (probably) never been addressed before. He rambled on about his disastrous health care bill to a crowd of 40,000 (obviously, mostly kids), waxed nostalgic about sexual escapades a rich pal had on his yacht back in the day, railed against the “Fake News,” and encouraged the crowd to boo former President Obama. Letting Trump lead them in unscoutsmanlike behavior is not a good look for the organization, especially since reversing their stance on LGBTQ+, they’ve been a pretty laudable outfit. If you want to tell them what you think of their judgment on this matter, they can be found @boyscouts on Twitter, www.scouting.org  online, or 972-580-2000 by phone.

We know, we know - Trump behaving badly? Of course, he's a lost cause. The Scouts, however, have proved they can do better when their feet are held to the campfire. Let’s let them know that tacitly approving of bullying behavior really toasts our marshmallows.  And hey, fellas, maybe not let President Pussygrabber address a bunch of impressionable kids next time?"
"Your DGB for today is to contact one of six GOP senators who we can flip against the Motion to Proceed on health care debate in the Senate.

We feel like this has been the longest inning ever, but we really are in the final stretch for all the various health care bill incarnations...maybe.

By most accounts, tomorrow morning, the Senate will vote on a Motion to Proceed on healthcare legislation. Trump and McConnell are desperate to pass something- anything before August recess, and desperate people are dangerous. If the MTP passes, a good 20 hours of debate will begin over a health care bill we won’t even know the content of, followed by a vote on it. We don’t know if Senators will be voting on the House-passed version, which was really bad, the Senate version, which is miraculously worse, some Frankenstein bill, or a full repeal.

Today, you’ll pick an iffy senator and call, fax, or email them and beg them to vote against the MTP and, if it comes to it, any health care bill rushed through this week. The up-for-grabs senators include Lee of Utah, Flake from Arizona, Portman from Ohio, Hoeven of North Dakota, Heller of Nevada, and Murkowski from Alaska. You can find their contact info here: https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm. Or, if you prefer, you can use Countable, IssueVoter, Resistbot, or any other resistance tool to get in touch and, we hate to say it but, literally beg for your life and the lives of millions of other United States Citizens."
"Your DGB for today is to purchase a special version of Cards Against Humanity.

As with many products marketed towards women, you will pay the “pink tax.” This means you’ll purchase the same game in a hot pink box for an extra five bucks. (There’s even a period pack if you’re interested). But this time, the extra money is for a good cause - the profits will be donated to Emily’s List, an organization which supports women who are running for public office.

Don’t want the game, or simply don’t want to pay more for a product simply because you are a woman? Another option is to send a donation directly to Emily’s List and help get more women in office. See our first Grab on Emily’s list here: https://www.dailygrabback.com/todays-grab-1/2017/1/31/a-womans-place-is-in-political-office?rq=emily%27s

What’s the deal with the pink tax, anyway? According to the NYC Department of Human Affairs Gender Pricing Study, companies often increase prices for products marketed towards women, including toys and children’s clothing, feminine hygiene products, and senior home/health care products. Basically, they set us up to pay more from birth. This doesn’t make us see pink. It makes us see RED."
"Your DGB for today is to contact the FCC to comment on the proposed new rules regulating the internet and demand the net remain neutral.

Is it Groundhog Day? Did we not win this battle back in 2014? Didn’t we do a Grab on this back in March? Well, a progressive’s work is never done. Or, as the rally sign says “I can’t believe I still have to protest this shit.”

The latest skirmish in the Trump administration’s battle to sell critical public services to corporate oligarchs is at the FCC. The agency has proposed new regulations that will open the door for internet service providers to hold your access to Game of Thrones (or usajobs.gov or your state’s voter registration page....) for ransom. Pay, or have your access throttled. The comment period on these new, nasty regs is open until August 16, 2017.

Confused about what we’re asking for? Learn more about net neutrality and how the FCC makes its rules. You can send your comments to the FCC using a nice form provided by the Electronic Frontier Foundation or Save the Internet. Or if you’re wonkish, verbose, or just like to do things yourself, follow this tutorial to comment directly on the FCCs website.

Imagine a future where Comcast decides what you can do on the internet, and how much it will cost you. Sounds almost as bad as if Joffrey were still King of Westeros."
"Your DGB for today is to check out the No More Deaths organization.

Immigrating to the U.S. can be a risky undertaking for anyone, but for the poor it’s downright dangerous. None of the typical avenues are available to those that cannot afford the legal help or have existing connections, forcing these people to cross the border on foot via severely hot and dry areas along states like Arizona. And if the harsh terrain is not bad enough, the tactics of the Border Patrol are at their absolute worst in these areas.

The non profit organization, No More Deaths, seeks to help these people. From their website, “The mission of No More Deaths is to end death and suffering in the Mexico–US borderlands through civil initiative: people of conscience working openly and in community to uphold fundamental human rights.” Please go here to find out more about them: http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/about-no-more-deaths/

They have many volunteer opportunities which you can research here: http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/volunteer/faq/

Consider donating. They need clothing, first aid supplies, personal care items, and food. Cash is always appreciated. Addresses and other information can be found here: http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/donate-supplies-or-vehicles/

Mexico is trying to send us their best, let’s do ours to support them!"
"Your DGB for today is to learn how White House security clearances are issued and then give them hell to revoke Jared Kushner’s.

Jared Kushner has gotten himself into murky waters due to his dealings with Diaper Don and the Russian Lawyer. It is imperative that his security clearance be revoked after he lied about this meeting. This Michael Cera wannabe gets daily security briefings. I mean, come on.

Today we want you to contact the State Department and demand that they revoke his clearance. You can contact them here:

 

U.S. Department of State

2201 C Street NW

Washington, D.C. 20520

"Your DGB for today is to celebrate Made In America Week: a theme week invented by the White House to distract from their complete ineptitude and criminality.

We at DGB are happy to oblige this promotion, as it’s the first thing the administration has done that isn’t completely self-serving. You see, the Trumps don’t make things in America. Ivanka’s line is manufactured overseas and so is DJT’s. They use foreign steel in what real estate projects are actually in America. Hell, even his campaign opposition research was outsourced to Russians.

Assuming the White House isn’t being intentionally ironic with this theme, here are some products actually made in the USA, with leadership on the right side of history:

 

Dr. Bronners products are made in California, with the company donating $50,000 to the National Immigration Law Center in response to January’s Muslim Ban Executive Order.

 

K’NEX are made in a Pennsylvania factory visited by Hillary Clinton during her 2016 campaign to not kill us all.

 

The Levi Strauss Foundation donated one million dollars to various progressive non-profits this year, including the Council of American-Islamic relations and the Transgender Law Center.

 

Lodge Cookware, made in Tennessee, is great cast-iron cookware family company with a commitment to recycling.

 

LUSH beauty products has always championed inclusivity and diversity. This year, they’ve released a product called “Yuge”, which gives you the opposite of Trump’s hair: voluminous and healthy.

"Your DGB for today is to check out this awesome new podcast, “On One with Angela Rye.”

If you’re like us, you’ve been celebrating the voices and faces that give us life during these dark and deeply weird days. Angela Rye, a frequent guest on CNN, NPR, and elsewhere, has been providing some of the very best commentary, analysis, and epic side-eyes this year. No one has been better at shooting down spin and the “alternative facts” coming out of Trumpworld than Rye. Want proof? Check out this clip of her showing the door to Trump apologist, Joe Walsh, saying that she doesn’t “talk to bigots.” Now Rye, whose impressive resume can be seen here, has her very own platform, where she says she’s going to discuss politics, race, and pop culture. On One’s first interview was with the inimitable Maxine Waters, which we think says a lot about the level of awesomeness this podcast will aspire to.

So tune in and #ResistYall. We will be."
"Your DGB for today is to sign up for alerts from OhmConnect.

One downside of being eco-conscious is that it doesn’t involve much instant gratification. Sure, you may be rescuing your great-great grandchildren from a post-apocalyptic future of riding around the desert, fighting over gas and battling out their differences in the Thunderdome but chances are you will be dead and gone long before then. OhmConnect seeks to change that a bit but also make saving energy a lot more fun.

From its website, OhmConnect is a free “service designed to offset the effects of dirty power plants by alerting you when you should save energy.”

"Your DGB for today is to team up with Eric Holder and make redistricting sexy.

Former Attorney General Eric Holder and some of his coolest friends (psstt...it’s Barack Obama) are teaming up to work on redistricting for 2021. Yes, we understand that is a VERY long way away, and if 45 stays our president for the next 3 years, 3 months, and 22 days, give or take (we’re bad at math) then it is going to feel like a thousand lifetimes. But just because it’s far off doesn’t mean we shouldn’t plan for it. Redistricting and gerrymandering have a huge impact on elections. At least 16 GOP House seats are a direct result of gerrymandering and if we want future elections to fair, then we need to start working on it now.

"Your DGB for today is to participate in or support the Women’s March action on July 14th and 15th, protesting the National Rifle Association and their recent video.

In late June the National Rifle Association aired a chilling video which appears to slyly encourage its membership to take up arms against protesters and the left. On its own, the video is inflammatory - but against the backdrop of a culture of violence embraced by our own president and perpetrated disproportionately against women and People of Color, it is downright terrifying. The Women’s March decries this video and the racist double standard represented by the NRA’s silence in the face of Philando Castile’s death. Therefore it is organizing a march on Friday starting on the steps the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, VA and ending 17 miles later at the US Department of Justice in Washington, DC. It also plans an event at the DOJ on Saturday. We encourage you to participate if you can, donate a few bucks, or at least signal boost the march on social media.

If you do attend, please be safe. We don’t want to be alarmist, but gun-related protests may bring out gun-carrying counter-protesters. Keep your wits about you.

By the way, if you are starting to feel worn out from all this political action, we get it. We REALLY do. Check out our blog on how to combat protest fatigue.  Finally, if you are short on sign ideas, we humbly submit DGB’s very own all-purpose protest poster, here.

"Your DGB for today is to fight this extreme heat and spread some sweet relief.

Thanks to The Chinese Hoax, otherwise known as climate change, locations throughout our country and planet have recently suffered extremely hot temperatures, and not the Nelly kind. Arizona and the Southwest have seen record setting highs, grounding airplanes and generally making life miserable for those that live there (prompting us to ask, HOW DO THEY?!). Even if you aren’t being melted in the desert, this is a hot and nasty time of year for much of the U.S. What we would like you to do today is to help relieve the heat for your fellow sufferers.

The homeless can be hit the hardest by extreme temperatures. Please consider putting together a resource bag to pass out containing bottled water (freeze until you are ready to leave the house!), some light snacks like energy bars, fruit, and a pair or two of socks. Socks will help protect the feet from hot pavement and wick away some of the sweat. Other items like baby wipes and sunscreen are also useful.

Bone up on your heat-induced illness knowledge by checking out the signs and symptoms from the CDC here: https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/extremeheat/warning.html

Download the CDC’s helpful heat illness first aid suggestions and post somewhere you can refer to them easily: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/UserFiles/works/pdfs/2017-128.pdf

Don’t forget that birds and other wild animals also suffer during heat waves. Keep your birdbaths and feeders on your penthouse rooftop where birds are feedin’ at the top of the Fo’ Seasons full of fresh water and food so they can stay healthy too."
"Your DGB for today is to tweet or email Speaker Paul Ryan a picture of your shoulders.

We're sure you've all heard that a dress code barring open toed shoes and sleeveless tops is currently being enforced in the House of Representatives. It is important to note that this dress code is not new and has been around since Speaker Pelosi, but what is new is that they are now imposing it. A few female reporters have been turned away, despite there being no signage outlining the actual dress code.

We want you to tweet or email a picture of your shoulders to Speaker Paul Ryan, using #ShouldersAreScandalous and whatever else you feel like bringing up when you troll him. Sure, the men have a dress code too, like being required to wear a tie, but only one dress code punishes women for something as benign as flashing some shoulder skin. We have to push back against the GOP and their delight in finding new and bizarre ways to punish women every day. We aren’t quite to the point of living in the Republic of Gilead, but we are pretty damn close. Get out there and show those shoulders, men and women!"
"Your DGB for today is to get involved with Unchained At Last, and help end child marriage in the United States.

First, we need you to read this shocking op-ed on child marriage. Some horrific facts from it include stats like between 2000 and 2010, 167,000 children in 28 states were married. Some of these children are as young as 12, and many are marrying adult men. Because a few states could not provide data, it is estimated that close to 250,000 children were married in that decade. Many of these marriages are forced, and some end in violence, leaving the children with no place to go because domestic violence shelters will not accept minors. Children also aren’t allowed to legal actions in their own name, leaving them with no chance for divorce.

This is where Unchained At Last steps in. Unchained provides client services, advocacy, and education. You can help their cause in many different ways, like donating, becoming a pro-bono lawyer or psychotherapist, volunteering, or asking your Legislators to stop child marriage. Children should be children, not brides, and we all have the responsibility to make sure that happens."

She outlines why she and her staff believe it is a fake, and she explains why someone might want her show to run this story, based on a ginned-up NSA document. Maddow believes that someone [insert chin rubbing emoji here] wants to discredit her show and the media in general as it pertains to the Russian election-meddling AND possible collusion by the Trump campaign in that effort."

(Interesting information found here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/28/body-on-yoga_n_4109595.html) Unfortunately these benefits are elusive to many people due to the cost of classes, access to a studio, or even social anxiety.

"Your DGB for today is to watch this video gone viral posted by Brittlestar (if you haven’t already seen it) - hopefully you’ll have a laugh and learn a little something about our neighbors to the north.

In honor of our token Canuck at DGB, we thought we’d lighten it up and have you watch a quick video regarding the things Canadians celebrate on Canada Day. If, however, this video is NOT amusing to you and instead sends you into yet another downward spiral of despair that we’ve all been having bouts of since November, remember Canada had to endure several years of Stephen Harper while America got to enjoy Obama. Oh, how the tables have turned *sob*. We won’t make the cliche joke about moving to Canada, however, because DGB is committed to the cause of fighting to the bitter end to protect our fellow Americans from 45.

He is a pro-choice progressive, Iron Workers union member that supports a $15 minimum wage and a single-payer health care system. *insert bursting heart eyes emoji* He is aiming to unseat Dude Bro of the House, Paul Ryan, who is up for re-election in 2018.

"Your DGB for today is to contact your senators and tell them to vote NO on the health care bill.

After weeks of subterfuge and clandestine meetings, the GOP Factory of Terrible Ideas Made Even Worse finally produced their promised health care bill. We probably don’t have to tell you that it means bad things for practically every human being living in the United States, but we are going to anyway. If this bill passes (and it very much is still in play) the Congressional Budget Office predicts:

Huge increases in premiums for low income and older people

Deep cuts to Medicaid spending

20 million people losing insurance altogether over the next 10 years

If that’s not enough to inspire you to pick up a phone or fire up Resistbot, did you know that it also eliminates Essential Health Benefits and prohibits private insurance companies from covering abortion?

"Your DGB for today is to tell your favorite news source to either boycott the White House press briefings, or record video despite the gag order.

The current White House has placed a block on video and live audio recordings of White House press briefings. Rumors have been flying about the reason why, some as ridiculous as Steve Bannon’s comment that Spicer “got fatter” and some more serious such as the beginning of the end of freedom of speech. Regardless of the reason, it is ridiculous and infringes on our rights as American citizens. It leaves one questioning, what exactly are they going to limit next?

So what can we do about it? We can call or email our favorite news source which has a representative in the press corps, and tell them to boycott the damn things. What exactly is the point of the press briefing if we are getting outright lied to, important questions are being avoided, or we can’t even see their faces telling us the lies? Honestly, there’s no point. So today we are asking you to call the White House Press Corps, CNN, WaPo, New York Times, MSNBC or your favorite White House press corps member and asking them to either boycott the press briefings, or break the rules and videotape them. This is our government and we have every right to know what is being said and done. After all, we do pay their salaries. So call, tweet, e-mail… whatever your preferred contact method is and DEMAND better. Tell them that enough is enough. Either we see the full press briefings, in all all their dishonest glory, or we make the news up all by ourselves. After all, we are pretty damn creative and can go a long way with the dossier stories."
"Your DGB for today is to look into options for proclaiming your home or business a safe space.

Since the election, neighborhoods have come together to protest hatred and bigotry with different exterior displays. One popular way of demonstrating inclusiveness is the rainbow peace flag, which you can find on Amazon.

Another option is the Hate Has No Home Here sign.

We at DGB understand that the American flag theme and colors don’t necessarily represent all of us, and we recognize that the Hate Has No Home Here signs aren’t perfect. Recently, there has been some recognition that the traditional rainbow flag also leaves people of color underrepresented, which prompted a modified version to be released. You can find downloadable artwork on the More Color More Pride site, which means you can even create your very own extra gay, extra inclusive super yard sign.

On a personal note, those of us at DGB who are minorities find these neighborhood signs comforting. Better still, our children recognize them as signifying safe places and love spotting them on car rides."
"Your DGB for today is to support women in the arts.

For centuries, women have fought against the idea that they aren’t as creative or as artistic as men. They had to use aliases when writing books, otherwise they wouldn’t get published. The question “Why have there been no great women artists?” has been asked countless times, and has been used as an incorrect basis for the belief that women just can’t produce good art. To quote Linda Nochlin from her essay titled after this question, “(b)ut in actuality, as we all know, things as they are and as they have been, in the arts as in a hundred other areas, are stultifying, oppressive, and discouraging to all those, women among them, who did not have the good fortune to be born white, preferably middle class and, above all, male. The fault lies not in our stars, our hormones, our menstrual cycles, or our empty internal spaces, but in our institutions and our education…”

So what can we do to help women that want to create art? How can we support them? The very first and easiest thing you can do is to buy their art. There’s tons of ways to support women in the arts like seeing the new Wonder Woman movie, which was directed by a women, or purchasing a book, album, or original piece of art. The next thing you can do is to attend local art shows featuring women’s art. You can also check out the National Museum of Women in the Arts for more ideas on how to advocate, and to donate to women in the arts.

Women are 51% of the world’s population, but their art is underrepresented. If you have seen Wonder Woman, which we highly recommend, you may have found yourself crying at moments that wouldn’t normally have brought tears to your eyes. Representation matters and you can show that by supporting women in all their artistic endeavors."
"Your DGB for today is to make a list of ways you can grab back weekly, in your local community.

DGB is all about building up our local communities. You can spend hours every day trying to fix Washington, but we all know what stands at the heart of real change happens in local communities. Washington can pass all the laws and bills they want, but it won’t change a things if we aren’t changing minds and hearts at the local level.

So today we are asking you to look at your community and find a need that you and your friends and family can fill. We encourage you to try and do something once a week for the entire summer. Many of the actions you take can be as short as five minutes, with a big community pay off.

 

Some suggestions from DGB are:

Clean up your local park or your neighborhood. This is as simple as taking a walk and carrying a trash bag with you.

Volunteer at a local animal shelter. Animal shelters need volunteers to feed and walk the animals. Added bonus is you get all the puppy and kitty loves, without having to clean up their accidents on your new rug. Alternatively, if you do enjoy cleaning, it’s kitten season, and shelters need foster homes.

Put together care packages to drop off at your local homeless shelter, or to keep in your car if you see someone in need. Reusable water bottles are extra nice for these hot summer days.

Contact a local senior center and go play games with the residents. Beware: Bingo is not for the faint of heart."
"Your DGB for today is to help save student aid.

Have you ever wondered why countries like Singapore have such good economies despite having virtually no natural resources at their disposal? Well the answer is simple: they consider the human brain a resource and invest in it accordingly. Wouldn’t it be nice if the Trump administration and Congress treated the brains of their constituents with as much respect and importance as they do a gallon of oil or a pound of coal?

We are sure that this is hardly the first time you’ve heard this, but college is really, really expensive. So expensive, in fact, that the poor and middle class are increasingly priced out and/or burdened with outrageous debt loads. If you have wondered about this phenomenon but need more information please take the time to view this short video that gives a quick and easy breakdown of the situation.

One of the vitally important ways that we can provide assistance to those that want to get higher education (keep in mind that these funds cover all kinds of secondary education, including trade school) is through Federal financial aid programs. According to the Student Aid Alliance these programs will suffer a heavy hit under Trump’s proposed budget. There is still time to make our voice heard and help stop this direct assault on the future. The Student Aid Alliance has set up a page where you can message your senator or representative (please do both if you can) and tell them why it is so important to preserve these programs. It can be found at this link: https://studentaidalliance.org/write-your-legislator/?vvsrc=%2fcampaigns%2f51900%2frespond

They are also leading a Twitter campaign and we suggest you check it out and join in."
"Your DGB for today is to support the Clean the World Foundation.

Communicable disease is still a huge problem that kills millions of people,  mostly children, every year. While dirty water contributes to the issue, did you know that another problem is lack of access to soap? Clean the World is looking to solve that problem while also giving hotels the chance to lessen their environmental impact. This organization collects slightly used soap bars and bottles from individual hotels and hotel chains and recycles it into new soap. It then distributes it to communities in need.

 

Clean the World also provides:

Emergency Relief and Humanitarian Aid

Outcome-Based Hygiene Education Programs

Microloans

Local Hygiene Promotion Programs

Community Engagement

 

Please go to the Clean the World Health Statistics web page and check out this information: https://cleantheworld.org/need-and-impacthealth-statistics/

If you want to go a step further you can also volunteer or organize a volunteer event at one of their recycling locations. Those are currently in Orlando, Las Vegas and Hong Kong. They also appreciate donations as little as $1.

And you thought those tiny little bottles of shampoo were silly. Hotel toiletries might not save the world, but they could go a surprisingly long way towards saving lives."
"Your DGB for today is to stand up and be counted as a person committed to creating a gender equal world.

By adding your name to the UN Women’s project “He for She” (and posting about it on social media), you’re amplifying their mission to improve women’s lives all over the globe. The United Nations formed UN Women in 2010 as the U.N.’s “Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.” In doing so, the United Nations has endorsed the principle exemplified by Hillary Clinton’s 1995 speech to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women: “human rights are women’s rights and women’s rights are human rights.” Kofi Annan, who served as the United Nations’ Secretary-General for nine years, went on to say that “...study after study has taught us that there is no tool for development more effective than the empowerment of women. No other policy is as likely to raise economic productivity, or to reduce infant and maternal mortality. No other policy is as sure to improve nutrition and promote health -- including the prevention of HIV/AIDS. No other policy is as powerful in increasing the chances of education for the next generation. And I would also venture that no policy is more important in preventing conflict, or in achieving reconciliation after a conflict has ended.”

After you’ve channeled your inner Wonder Woman and committed to world-wide female empowerment, check out the ideas the UN offers for how to get involved in the areas that interest you most."
"Your DGB for today is to discover your American Dream Score.

Are you a bootstrapper? Graduate of the School of Hard Knocks? Born with a silver spoon in your mouth? Maybe you’ve always considered yourself an Average Joe/Joan. When pursuing the American Dream, which is loosely defined as moving up the socioeconomic ladder, but also might mean maintaining the rung you were born on, we often underestimate the role that luck plays in our success or failure. Yes, luck. Fate, destiny, foreshadowing - here in America we like to brand ourselves as rugged individuals in complete control of our future through a series of carefully made choices. But that is simply not the case. Pure, dumb circumstances of birth, health, and timing play significant roles in determining how well we do as individuals.

The progressive agenda seeks to help balance those impacts to assist every human in realizing their potential. In order to understand this, it’s important to see how our own life has been impacted by chance. Please use a few minutes to take this quiz from Moving Up USA to get your American Dream score: https://movingupusa.com

There is nothing inherently wrong with being born with privilege. But if we want a fair and just society we need to recognize where it exists, and where it doesn’t."
"Your DGB for today is to call, yes call, your senators and their staffers and demand they vote no on Trumpcare.

Trumpcare, or AHCA, is moving it’s way through the Senate and almost no one has seen it. What we do know is that it’s just as awful as the House Bill and will kick millions of people off of their insurance plans and make it harder for many to get and afford insurance. It is expected to be sent to get it’s CBO score any day now, which takes about two weeks. The Senate is trying it’s best to get a vote before they close for recess on July 4th, all while not allowing any hearings on it. At all.

Today we are totally ripping off the advice from our crush and former Obama speechwriter, Jon Favreau. On his podcast “Pod Save America” he suggested that we call the health care staffers of Republican Senators who are moderate republicans and might vote no. You can find the list on his twitter feed. Give your heartfelt appeal for them to vote no and ask them if they know what they bill is even about. Jon also wants you to go even further though and to call your own Senator, even if they are a democrat, and ask them what they are going to do to stop this bill. Obviously they are voting no, but what else? Are they going to filibuster? Stop Senate business? There’s a lot more they can do besides just voting no and it is imperative that this bill is stopped. You can find your Senator here: https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/ .

Trumpcare is one of the many things that 45 is pushing to try to erase everything Obama did. He’s a petty man, with a petty grudge, and unfortunately his grudge could kill people. Call your senators and demand they stop this bill and let you know how they plan to do so."
"Your DGB for today is to contact NBC and tell them we’re not okay with the network giving conspiracy-theorist Alex Jones air time. You can call the network at (212) 664-2333, write to them at NBC News, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10112, or tweet your views @NBCNews, and/or @MegynKelly.

Newly-minted NBC news anchor Megyn Kelly prompted us to give her the side-eye when her first big interview on the network was with the authoritarian leader, who probably has his grubby meathooks in our government, Vladimir Putin. But this next interview is beyond the pale. Next Sunday, Kelly is slated to sit down with Alex Jones, the man who creates and spreads fake news through his radio show and his website, Infowars. Jones has been behind a lot of looney-tunes conspiracy theories, but none quite as despicable, as his claim that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax. Infowars has already been validated (sorta) by being issued White House press credentials, courtesy of our favorite administration. Jones should not be further rewarded for this cruel nonsense by being legitimized on a network that ought to know better.

Without fake news, we probably wouldn’t have Trump in the White House. This is not the time to let NBC amplify the voices of fake news purveyors, like Jones, without hearing from us.

"Your DGB for today is to contact your Representatives and ask them to provide funding to end the backlog of rape kits.

Did you know that there are almost 200,000 untested rape kits in the United States? Rape kit tests are invasive and often make the victim feel victimized all over again, but they are a vital part of finding and convicting the perpetrator. So why have so many gone untested, leaving thousands of rapists on the street? The main reason is funding. Most police departments just do not have the funding to send in all their kits. Some states have started allocating more money for rape kits, but not all. Some states are getting creative with it, like Texas, who sent a bill to their Governor's desk, allowing crowdfunding to cover costs for rape kit tests.

We want you to check out the website http://www.endthebacklog.org/. It’s run by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by DGB’s personal shero, Mariska Hargitay from Law & Order: SVU. The website has more stats and info about rape kit backlogs and also provides a script for contacting your representatives. You can also donate to their efforts and help them get the word out.

We have a long way to go in ending rape culture and preventing sexual assault. Ending this backlog is one big step. Maybe next we can tackle the ridiculous statute of limitations for reporting rape."
"Your DGB for today is to share this story about Mike Pence’s governing abilities across social media.

If you’re like us, you may be looking into our country’s post-Trump future and emotionally eating over the thought of President Pence. Well, we can look to Pence’s governorship of Indiana as an indication of his style of leadership, which is not all that different than his boss’. You see, Mike has a habit of promising people money he doesn’t have, screwing them over, and leaving failed ventures behind. In short, Pence celebrated Indiana’s bicentennial by getting the ball rolling on nearly 60 million dollars worth of fancy plazas and various other commemorative construction plans, promising creative budgeting to fund the projects. The money never showed up, and Indiana lawmakers are now bailing out the former Governor on the taxpayers’ dime. Great job, Mike.

 Today being our 200th Grab, we at DGB looked into constructing our own bicentennial plaza, but, like most people who can’t afford something, we didn’t spend money we don’t have."
"Your DGB for today is to donate a dollar or two - whatever you can spare - to a suicide prevention card project so that Stop-Homophobia.com can get cards with hotline info into the hands of LGBTQ folks all over the world.

The current crew in the White House is the most aggressively anti-LGBTQ administration we’ve ever seen. Suicide among LGBTQ youth is already tragically high and we could well see an uptick since the 2016 election.

We’d like to celebrate Pride month by doing everything we can to save lives. Stop-Homophobia has set its own aggressive goal of printing and distributing two million cards globally, each of which list major suicide hotlines for youth (and adults) at risk. A full list of suicide hotlines can be found here on their website. (Some people feel more comfortable using peer helplines as an alternative to organized suicide prevention hotlines. Look for ones in your area.)

If you would like a box of these cards to distribute at your event or through your organization, send your information to info@stop-homophobia.com All of us together can help hurting people know there are other options than suicide."
